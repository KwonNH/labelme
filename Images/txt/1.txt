The work is entitled Il bacio. Episode of youth. Costumes of the fourteenth century, but is commonly known only as The Kiss. It was painted in 1859 by Francesco Hayez.
<br>It is an oil on a rectangular canvas, with the longest side placed vertically: it is 112 cm high and 88 wide.
<br>The subject to be described is rather simple: the picture depicts in a realistic way a young man and a young woman tightened in a passionate embrace, while they kiss on the lips with transport.
<br>The two, elegantly dressed in medieval clothes, are inside an empty space in a period building.
<br>The point of view is frontal, the two lovers are portrayed in full length and on a reduced scale: they measure about half of the whole painting.
<br>To better describe the work, let us now try to imagine it divided into 9 sectors of equal size, obtained by crossing three columns with three rows. To each sector, by convention, we give the numbering used in telephone keyboards. From left to right: 1, 2, 3 at the top; 4, 5, 6 in the middle; 7, 8, 9 below.
<br>We begin the description from the central sectors, 5 and 8 (and partly also 2), where the two young people are placed.
<br>The two are located one in front of the other: the female figure in the foreground, turned away, is enveloped by the male figure, turned towards us instead.
<br>The taller young man bends over his beloved to kiss her, gently holding her head in his hands: with his right hand he gently lifts her face and with his left he supports her neck. While holding the right leg straight to the ground, he bends his left leg and rests his foot on the first of three steps of a staircase that rises and occupies sector 9 of the canvas.
<br>The young woman in her beloved's arms, reflexively responds to his bending over her, by arching her back, holding on to the young man's shoulder with her left hand. To kiss him she barely turns towards us, and so we see the left profile of her body and face.
<br>The painter pays great attention to clothes.
<br>The young man is wearing a pointed hat, dove-gray and with dark feathers on the side, from which brown and frizzy hair comes out. His face is almost completely hidden by the headdress.
<br>He wears a wide brown cape down to the knees, which slips off the right shoulder to partially uncover the dark green jacket. Under the open cape, tied to the belt, we see a dagger. A red tights and brown leather shoes complete his clothing.
<br>The young woman has long light brown hair gathered in a soft hairstyle that leaves them partly loose behind her shoulders.
<br>She is wearing a long light blue dress, so shiny that it looks like silk satin, with a tight bodice, tight sleeves, and a wide skirt that falls all the way to the floor. Under the dress a white shirt emerges from the collar, the cuff and the sleeve, opening around the elbow in a broad puff. Golden embroidery adorns the wrist and neck of the dress, while a cord, always gilded, tightens the hips.
<br>A wall of blocks of light stone is the background of the scene, especially in sectors 2, 3 and 6, while the floor is made of brick-colored terracotta tiles, arranged in a herringbone pattern, and occupies sectors 7 and 8, and then stops in sector 9, where there are three large ascending steps in light stone.
<br>In sectors 1 and 4, on the stone wall, a thin and high column delimits an opening that introduces us to a rather dark space.
<br>We can only see a part of the entrance arch that continues outside the picture.
<br>Beyond this opening, in sector 4, behind a sharp arch, another dimly lit space is shown. in which we barely see, against the light, a human figure that descends to a lower floor.
<br>The lighting of the scene, apart from this dark area on the left, is intense and comes from a source outside the painting, at 10 o'clock.
<br>The light strikes in particular the left side of the girl, lighting the folds of the blue satin of the dress with almost white reflections, and projects the shadow of the two youngs quite clearly on the stairway and on the right side of the canvas.
<br>On a background entirely played on neutral tones, the bright colors used for the clothes of the two young people, flooded with light, stand out.
