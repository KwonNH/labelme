The episode which inspired this painting is described in the Gospel of Luke.
<br>A few days after the crucifixion of Jesus, two of his disciples are walking to Emmaus, a village not far from Jerusalem, and on the way they meet a man who joins to their speeches. Evening arrived, The three stop in a tavern and there, while they are having dinner, the unknown wanderer blesses and breaks the bread. With the its usual, extreme realism, the painter sets on canvas precisely the moment in which, during the act of blessing, the two disciples recognize that the wanderer is Jesus before he disappears from their sight. The work is an oil on canvas, rectangular, with the longer side placed horizontally; it measures 175cm in width and 141cm in height. The subject is represented practically in real size, i.e., on a 1:1 scale. In the painting we find Jesus and the two disciples seated around a table, while immediately behind, standing, a host and a maid are visible. The light illuminates the table and the group of characters, which fill completely the lower part and the right side of the painting, while the upper left part sinks in complete darkness. The viewpoint chosen by the artist is from in front : we observe this scene from a close distance and we can see the characters, both those seated that those on the feet, from the waist up. To get more details on the work, let's try now to imagine the canvas divided into 9 sectors of equal size, obtained by crossing three columns and three rows. To each sector, by convention, we give the numbering used in telephone keyboards : from left to right : 1, 2, 3 at the top, 4, 5, 6 in the middle, 7, 8, 9 at the bottom. We start from sectors 7, 8 and 9 where a rectangular table is visible, placed with the long side parallel to the base of the painting. The table is covered by a carpet and on it a white tablecloth, on which lie the shadows of the few things on the table: from left to right a loaf of bread and a ceramic plate  with some leaf vegetables. Behind it there is a broken loaf of bread. Still more to the right an empty plate of pewter and a carafe also in ceramic, which partially hides a chalice in glass containing red wine.
<br>We now consider the human figures, starting from those closer  to our point of view and going towards farther ones. In sectors 4 and 7, on the front side of the table, there sits a disciple turned with shoulders towards us; wearing a brown tunic on which is supported a lighter coloured mantle.
<br>He has curly hair, and his arms stretch slightly open towards Jesus, in a gesture of revelation and surprise. In sectors 6 and 9, on the short side of the table, sits the other disciple whom we see in profile ; wearing a brown tunic on which a cream coloured cloth is placed. He has a beard and mustache, short hair and a dark complexion. The surprise makes him wrinkle his face and stretch out his head towards Jesus, while with arms he firmly clings to the edges of the table. In sector 5, sitting at the side along the table in front to us, a bit moved to the left, we find Jesus, the fulcrum of the scene. He too is dressed in a dark green tunic and cape. He has a pale face, lit on one side, standing out from the background. He has a short beard and dark, wavy hair that fall over his shoulders. The gaze is directed toward the bottom. His right hand is raised and the fingers trace the gesture of blessing the bread that is in front of him, while his left hand is resting on the table. In sectors 2 and 5, immediately on the right behind Jesus there is the innkeeper. He wears a small white cap, a white shirt open at the collar and a darker blouse unbuttoned up to the middle of the chest. It is a no longer young man, depicted with a ruddy face and a furrowed broad forehead. He observes the gesture of blessing of Jesus, keeping his head down, with the chin that touches the neck and left hand closed in fist with the thumb tucked into his belt. In sectors 3 and 6, next to the landlord, we find an old maid, who wears modest clothes from work and a white cap that covers her dark and collected hair. She also has, as the innkeeper, the face furrowed by wrinkles. She is the only one who does not look at Jesus : she keeps her eyes down, while with her hands she holds a plate of meat. The scene is illuminated by a warm light, coming from a source which is not visible, located at10 o'clock. The figures around the table seem to gush from a gloomy and impenetrable bottom , which enhances their contours, making them vivid and almost tangible. The colors are all shades of brown and earthy.
